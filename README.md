# Machine Learning with Python from Scratch

Welcome to the "Machine Learning with Python from Scratch" repository! In this project, I will delve deep into the world of machine learning by initially implementing 10 famous machine learning algorithms using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and Numpy. Afterward, I will demonstrate how to implement the same algorithms using scikit-learn for comparison. The goal of this project is to understand the core principles and inner workings of these algorithms, all while using only the numpy library for numerical operations.

## Algorithms

I will be implementing the following machine learning algorithms from scratch and then using scikit-learn for comparison:

1. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Decision Trees
5. Random Forest
6. Naive Bayes Classifier
7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
8. Perceptron
9. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
10. k-Means Clustering

Each algorithm will have its own dedicated folder with detailed implementations and explanations.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `Folder(algorithm_name)/`: Contains the implementation of each machine learning algorithm.
   - `algorithm_name.py`: Implementation of the algorithm from scratch.
   - `main.py`: Fit the implemented model with data and chcek accrucy.
   - `Using Sklearn/`: Implementation of the algorithm using scikit-learn for comparison.

- `examples/`: Provides usage examples and sample scripts demonstrating the algorithms.

- `README.md`: The main documentation file you're currently reading.
